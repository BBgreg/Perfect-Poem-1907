Words dance like petals in the wind,
Each line a breath, each stanza a dream,
Painting pictures only hearts can see.

The rhythm flows like water over stones,
Smooth and gentle, yet powerful and deep,
Carrying whispers of ancient stories,
In verses that speak to the soul.`,

    'Sonnet': `When ${description} fills the morning air,
And sunlight dances through the leaves above,
The world awakens to a beauty rare,
A testament to nature's endless love.

Each moment holds a treasure to behold,
In simple things that often go unseen,
The stories that through generations told,
Of life's eternal, ever-changing scene.

So let us pause and breathe the sweet perfume,
Of ${description} that surrounds us here,
And find in every flower's gentle bloom,
A reason to hold all of life more dear.

For in these moments, fleeting though they are,
We glimpse the beauty of our guiding star.`,

Peace in simple things.`,

That filled every heart with delight,
It danced through the day,
In its own special way,
And made everything feel just right.`,

That dances in moonlight so fair,
With stories of old and of new,
And magic that floats in the air.

The wind carries whispers of wonder,
Through valleys and over the hill,
Where ${description} waits in the silence,
And time itself seems to stand still.`,

Beautiful, serene
Dancing, flowing, singing
Bringing joy to all who see
Wonder.`,

Through seasons of change and of rest,
In patterns that never decay.

Though time may seem to slip away,
The ${description} remains our guest,
The ${description} returns with each new day.

In moments when we pause to pray,
We find the ${description} at its best,
In patterns that never decay.

The ${description} shows us how to play,
And puts our weary hearts to test,
The ${description} returns with each new day.

So let us not forget the way
The ${description} makes us blessed,
In patterns that never decay.
The ${description} returns with each new day.`
