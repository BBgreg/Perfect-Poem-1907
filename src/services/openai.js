Words dance like petals in the wind,
Each line a breath, each stanza a dream,
Painting pictures only hearts can see.

The rhythm flows like water over stones,
Smooth and gentle, yet powerful and deep,
Carrying whispers of ancient stories,
In verses that speak to the soul.`,

    'Sonnet': `When ${description} fills the morning air,
And sunlight dances through the leaves above,
The world awakens to a beauty rare,
A testament to nature's endless love.

Each moment holds a treasure to behold,
In simple things that often go unseen,
The stories that through generations told,
Of life's eternal, ever-changing scene.

So let us pause and breathe the sweet perfume,
Of ${description} that surrounds us here,
And find in every flower's gentle bloom,
A reason to hold all of life more dear.

For in these moments, fleeting though they are,
We glimpse the beauty of our guiding star.`,

    'Haiku': `${description} whispers softâ€”
Morning dew on petals bright,
Peace in simple things.`,

    'Limerick': `There once was a ${description} so bright,
That filled every heart with delight,
It danced through the day,
In its own special way,
And made everything feel just right.`
